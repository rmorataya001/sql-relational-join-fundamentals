Structured PostgreSQL exercises covering relational joins, aggregation, NULL handling, and analytical query design.
# SQL Relational Join Fundamentals – PostgreSQL

## Overview

This repository documents structured practice focused on mastering SQL join behavior in PostgreSQL.

The objective of this project was to reinforce relational database fundamentals through repetition and controlled join scenarios. All queries were written manually as part of deliberate practice.

This work complements my ongoing SQL studies through a comprehensive SQL Bootcamp (30-hour program focused on relational logic, join visualization, and practical exercises).

## What I Practiced

This project focused strictly on join logic and relational behavior — without aggregation.

Core concepts reinforced:

- SELECT
- WHERE
- ORDER BY
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL JOIN
- LEFT ANTI JOIN (NULL filtering pattern)
- Handling NULL values in outer joins
- Understanding row inclusion vs exclusion behavior

This project intentionally did **not** include:

- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- SUM / COUNT
- Aggregation logic

The emphasis was on building strong relational intuition before progressing into analytical queries.

## Learning Approach

To accelerate structured repetition, I leveraged ChatGPT strategically to:

- Generate additional join-focused practice questions
- Create properly structured relational tables for experimentation
- Provide feedback on query logic

ChatGPT was used as a practice assistant — not to generate answers.

All SQL queries were written independently to reinforce mastery of join direction, matching logic, and NULL behavior.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is long-term SQL mastery through:

- Controlled repetition
- Clear conceptual understanding
- Incremental complexity
- Building strong fundamentals before advanced topics

Future projects will expand into aggregation, subqueries, window functions, and analytical query design.
